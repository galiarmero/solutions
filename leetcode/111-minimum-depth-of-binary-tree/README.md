# [Minimum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-depth-of-binary-tree/)

Explanation is pending. For now, you can check the solution:

- [Solution.java](./Solution.java) - BFS solution utilizing a queue, stops when the first leaf node is reached.
- [SolutionDFS.java](./SolutionDFS.java) - recursive solution employing DFS.Quite inefficient as it traverses each subtree first to calculate its depth before getting the minimum depth from the root.
